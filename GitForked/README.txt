Muzzle

A LOTRO (Lord of The Rings Online) Lua Plugin.


Short Description:

Muzzle trolls, spam, and keywords.


Long Description:

Muzzle trolls, spam, and keywords by filtering chat with a list of player names and keywords. Muzzle accomplishes this by forwarding wanted chat to the Standard channel, and leaving out unwanted chat.  Due to current LOTRO API limitations it is not currently possible to filter out of the originating channels. If this becomes possible in the future, this plugin may be updated with a better solution.


Suggested Usage:

Create a new chat tab for World chat.
It's recommended to rename this tab to '.',
and not pay any attention to this tab.

Create another new tab for Standard.
It's recommended to rename this tab to 'Main',
to signify that this is the tab you will want to read the chat from.


Special Thanks:

To Geramond for suggesting the working title "Troll Muzzle";
(later shortened to just Muzzle.)
